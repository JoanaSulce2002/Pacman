# Pac-Man Game

This project is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man game. It allows users to control Pac-Man to eat dots while avoiding ghosts.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**: 
    - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control Pac-Man's movement.
  
2. **Objective**:
    - Eat all the dots on the board to win the game.
    - Avoid colliding with ghosts, as it will result in losing a life.
    - Eating power dots will temporarily allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts.

3. **Game Mechanics**:
    - Pac-Man moves through the maze, consuming dots and avoiding ghosts.
    - If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, a life is lost, and Pac-Man returns to the starting position.
    - Eating power dots temporarily grants Pac-Man the ability to eat ghosts.
    - The game ends when all dots are eaten or when Pac-Man loses all lives.
